# Configuration Fixed - Home Assistant SNMP Limitations

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your Home Assistant configuration warnings have been resolved! The errors were caused by using parameters that the SNMP integration doesn't support.

### Issues Identified

The Home Assistant SNMP integration reported errors because we tried to use:

1. **`device` parameter** - Used to group entities under a single device
   - ❌ Not supported by `sensor.snmp`
   - ❌ Not supported by `switch.snmp`

2. **`unique_id` parameter** - Used for UI management
   - ✅ Supported by `sensor.snmp`
   - ❌ Not supported by `switch.snmp`

### Changes Made

#### Both Configuration Files Updated:
- ✅ Removed all `device` blocks from sensors
- ✅ Removed all `device` blocks from switches
- ✅ Removed `unique_id` from all switches
- ✅ Kept `unique_id` for all sensors (this is supported)

#### Files Modified:
1. `configuration.yaml` - Basic configuration
2. `configuration_with_power.yaml` - Configuration with power monitoring

## 📊 What This Means

### What Still Works:
- ✅ All sensors have `unique_id` - can be managed from UI
- ✅ All entity names include "cAPC3" prefix for easy identification
- ✅ All outlet controls work perfectly
- ✅ All monitoring sensors work as expected

### What Changed:
- ❌ Entities won't be grouped under a single "APC PDU cAPC3" device
- ❌ Switches can't be customized from UI (must edit YAML)
- ✅ All entities appear as individual items in Home Assistant

## 🔧 Workarounds Available

See **[LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md)** for detailed alternatives:

### Option 1: Use Areas (Recommended)
Group PDU entities by assigning them to a Home Assistant Area

### Option 2: Use Groups
Create a YAML group to organize entities together

### Option 3: MQTT Bridge (Advanced)
Use MQTT for full device support with proper grouping

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Reload your Home Assistant configuration**
   - The warnings should now be gone
   - All entities should load successfully

2. **Verify entities are created**
   - Go to Developer Tools → States
   - Look for entities starting with `sensor.capc3_` and `switch.capc3_`

3. **Optional: Set up grouping**
   - Read [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) for workaround options
   - Create an Area or Group to organize your PDU entities

## 📝 Configuration Status

| File | Status | Entities | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| `configuration.yaml` | ✅ Fixed | 40 (8 switches + 32 sensors) | Basic control only |
| `configuration_with_power.yaml` | ✅ Fixed | 56 (8 switches + 48 sensors) | Includes power monitoring |

## 🔍 Testing Commands

Verify everything works:

```bash
# Check configuration
ha core check

# View logs for any remaining errors
ha core logs --follow

# Restart Home Assistant
ha core restart
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will switches still work?**  
A: Yes! Switches work perfectly, you just can't customize them from the UI. You'll need to edit YAML for any changes.

**Q: Can sensors be customized?**  
A: Yes! Sensors have `unique_id` so they can be fully managed from the Home Assistant UI.

**Q: Why don't they appear under one device?**  
A: The SNMP integration doesn't support device grouping. This is a limitation of the integration itself, not your configuration.

**Q: Can this be fixed in the future?**  
A: If Home Assistant adds device support to the SNMP integration, we can update the configuration to use it.
